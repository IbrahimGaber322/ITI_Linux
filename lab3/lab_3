10.Execute the following command :
echo \ then press enter
What is the purpose of \ ?

Notice the prompt ”>” what is that? and how can you change it from “>” to “:”.


When you execute the command echo \, you're essentially using the backslash \ as an escape character. In this context, the backslash is escaping the newline character that follows it, preventing the shell from treating it as the end of the command.

The > prompt you're seeing indicates that the shell expects more input to complete the command. It's an indication that the command you entered is not yet complete, and the shell is prompting you to continue entering input.

To change the > prompt to :, you need to complete the command. In this case, you can either provide additional text to the echo command or simply press Enter to finish the command. After pressing Enter, the shell should execute the command, and you'll see the familiar prompt.
