# Try to edit the file

19. What is the difference between the “x” permission for a file and for a
directory?
--->
For a File:

For a file, the "x" (execute) permission means the ability to execute the file as a program or script.
If the "x" permission is set for a user on a file, it allows that user to run the file as a program.
For a Directory:

For a directory, the "x" (execute) permission has a different significance.
If the "x" permission is set for a user on a directory, it allows that user to access (enter or traverse) the directory and access its contents.
Without the "x" permission on a directory, even if a user has read ("r") permission on the directory, they won't be able to access or list its contents or navigate into it using commands like cd.
